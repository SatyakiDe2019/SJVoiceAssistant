# Personal Virtual Assistant (SJ) implemented using python-based OpenAI, Rev_AI & PyTtSX3.

## About this package

This python class will invoke a combination of AI packages, including ChatGPT OpenAI, Rev_AI & PyTtSX3 classes, to initiate the AI-enabled Virtual Assistant. This app is an excellent example of integrating multiple API services to create a helpful app. This project is for the advanced Python developer & Data Science Newbie.

Fun Fact: SJ comes from one of the iconic Bengali characters, Sidhu Jyatha (Uncle Sidhu), who happened to be a living encyclopedia before the internet sensation came into our life. This character was introduced by the iconic Bengali Film Director & Writer - Late Satyajit Roy. One would get a glimpse of him in one of the famous Bengali detective series, "Feluda." This voice assistant is a tribute to the legendary director.

I will modify this solution later to mimic his exact voice of him. At this moment, the voice is generated by AI.
